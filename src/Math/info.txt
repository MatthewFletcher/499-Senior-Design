Use histogram shape to approximate 

Discretization: go from cotninuous to discrete 
Numerical analysis methods 

Use computer to compute integrals by partitioning continuous into discrete 


Curve fitting is opposite of discretization

express pdf as a continous function

Rperesent a histogram of the data, and look at the top shape of the hiosgram. See how does that shape look. 

Could look like any shape, like bell curve, line, etc. 


When you roll a die, you get a discrete count o feach number 

Look at shape of histogram, 

Normal dist looks like a bell

Parameters of normal distribution are mean, and standard deviation

Once you figure out mean and standard deviation, then you can convert discrete values into cointinuous 


Regression modeling

r squared test, r squared coeff, 

Must eliminate outliers before regression modeling 

Model selection problem: which model beswt fits data 
Different coefficients to compuete regression modeling scores 

Mallows C_p corrrelation model 

Adjusted R2 model 


Principle of pacimony 

Find model with minimal amount of computing time

Everything you run costs energy.
